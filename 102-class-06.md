## JavaScript

### The ABCs of Programming

* JavaScript can be used to select any **element**, **attribute**, text from an HTML page. To **_add_ elements**, **attributes**, and **text** to the page, or **remove them**.


* Also it could be used to **specify a set of steps for the browser to follow** *(like a recipe)*, which **allows it to access or change the content of a page**.

* Browser compatibility is very important for the code to work so make sure to use a modern browser like Chrome or FireFox

* JavaScript is a programming langauge using **"Script"** as it's core principle, A script is a *series of instructions* that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. To **write** a script, you need to first **state** your **goal** and then **list** the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

* Start with the **big picture** of what you want to achieve, and **break** that down into **smaller steps**. Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to be acheived. This can be **represented** using a **flowchart**, and translate these steps into code.

* Always think like you were the computer and it will be easier to find the right approch to write the code.

* An expression **evaluates** into *(results in)* a single value, Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:

   1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
   2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

## Summary

1. Javascript makes our website functional and not dull and dumb.
2. You can make your website dynamic and compatable with different platforms.
3. Never write your javascript at the beggining of the HTML as it may cause malfunctions.
4. We can use the javascript to control our HTML and CSS when different events occur.
5. Java script is linked to the HTML using the tag `<script src= "path"></script>`.
6. We also learned how to copy the content of one repo to another using the `code cp -r source distination`.


## HTML, CSS and Javascript
The __three languages__ that are used to create web pages using the progressive enhancement approach are: **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**

__each language form a layer with a different purpose__
1. HTML forms the content layer which gives the page structure
1. CSS forms the presentation layer
1. Javascript forms the behavior layer
    - a js code can be added in an html code between tags, but it’s better to keep the js code in a separate file

### Basic JS intro:
__Statements__ A series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one is called a **script**, While an individual instruction/step is called a **statement**
- statements should end with a semicolon
- Comments Comments are used to explain what your code does and to make it easier to understand
- for a single-line comment: use //comment
- for a multi-line comment: use /*comment*/
- Variables Information use in a script are stored in variables
    - the information stored in a variable can change each time the script runs (that’s why they’re called variables)
    - variables must be declared befor they are used, which means they must be created and given a name, declaration is done as: var variable-name;, where var is the keyword for a variable

**Data Types JS has three data types**, which are:
1. Numbers: for numeric data
1. Strings: for letters and charecters, anything between (“ “) is a string
1. Booleans: have one value, True or False

**Naming Variables Rules In JS, there are six rules for naming a variable**, which are:
1. a name MUST NOT start with a number, it must start with a letter, ($) or ( _ )
1. a name MUST NOT contain a ( - ) or a ( . )
1. you can’t use a keyword or a reserved word
1. all variables are case sensetive
1. use a name that describes the information it stores
1. use camel case if the variable name has more than one word

# Computer Architecture and Logic.
## 4 Common things in all computers
1. Input
2. Storage
3. Processing
4. Output

## Binary and Data 
computers work with binary system

## Logic and circuits
Some simple circuits that use 1 and 0
- Not 
- And
- Or
- Xor
- Nand
- adder

## Hardware and software
software tells the cpu what to do

# How Computers Work


* Computers were invented to **carry** and **manipulate** information such as how mechanical machines were designed to manipulate physical stuff
And it was designed to do 4 things:

1. **Take an input**
2. **Store it**
3. **Process it**
4. **Give an output**

* Though we came so far in computer technology it still holds the same basic fucntionality of the previous 4 points.

* The **input** is what the user orders the computer to do wether it is a *voice input* or *a click* or *visual input* ...etc

* The computer then **stores** this **input** as an **information** inside it's **memory**

* The computer's **processor** takes this **information** and **manipulates** it using it **algorithms** _(which is a series of commands)_

* The computer **restores** the processed information in the **memory** and the last 2 steps are repeated till all information is ready to be delivered as an **output**

* An output varies depending on the type of the computer, it could be **visual**, **audio**, **text**, **AR**, **vr** ...etc

* This **output** could be used as an **input** to another computer for another process

* All computers use the **binary system** to **represent** all types of contents such as **text images**, **sounds** and **videos** by **converting** these content into **numbers** and then those numbers are **represented** in the **binary system** which later on is represented by the computer

* The binary system is a way to **carry electrical signals as information** through wires where each wire **represents a 0 or a 1**, a true or false

* Circuts are the components that are responsible for processing those information

* Each circut is a **logical process of 0s and 1s**, and by combining multiple tiny circuts togother we can process all types of information

* The more complicated the information gets the more powerful computer is needed to be able to store and process such information

* Even the advanced coding languages we use today get converted into 0s and 1s, a simple tag element consists of hunderds and thousands of 0s and 1s

* The **CPU** is the component that is responsible of doing all these processes

* The **OS** such as **Windows** is the master program that decide what other smaller programs can access of the input and output components on the computer

_**In the end the only thing that makes computers smarter each day is **US!!****_
