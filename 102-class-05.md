* CSS is considered the skin that covers the structure of our bodies it's how we are presented to other people.
* CSS is written using a syntax of selectors, these selectors do what it's name says; they select and element and then we assign a property such as color, size and width to that element.
* There are many types of selectors such as tag selectors, class selectors and id selectors each is different in syntax and priority.
