# Operators and Loops

- __Duckett__: JavaScript & jQuery.
    - Comparison and logical operators: **150-151**, **156**, and **157**.
    - for and while loops: **170 - 173**, and **176**.



The comparison operators are mainly used to get one boolean value output out of multiple inputs, and there are many operaters each has it's own job.

1. **Is equal to**: It's used to campare two variables to see if they are the same in value only `==`
2. **Is not equal to**: It's the opposite of _is equal to_ and it's used to see if two variable are not the same value only `!=`
3. **Strict equal to**: Similar to _is equal to_ but it checks if the two variables are equal in value and also **typing** `===`
4. **Strict not equal to**: The exact opposite of _strict equal to_ where it checks if the two variables are not equal in value and also **typing** `!==`
5. **Greater than**: It check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right `>`
6. **Less than**: It's the opposite of _greater than_ where it checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right `<`
7. **Greater than or equal to**: similar to _greater than_ but it checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right `>=`
8. **Greater than or equal to**: similar to _less than_ but it checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right `<=`

## Logical Operators

The logical operators are used to compare the results of more than one comparisn operator, and each one has a different logic to it.

1. **Logical and**: It's used to test if both of the expressions are true and outputs _true_, otherwise _false_ `&&`
2. **Logical or**: It's used to test if one of the expressions is true and outputs _true_, only when both are false it returns _false_ `||`
3. **Logical not**:It's used to reverse the state of and expression from _true_ to _false_ and vise-versa `!`

## Loops

Loops are used to check if a condition is true or false, and depending on the return value it runs a certain block of code inside of it several time until the return value becomes false, there are differnet types of loops simialr in functionality different in structure.

1. **For loop**: It's used to run a certain code for a certain know amount of times if the condition is met, the syntax looks like `for (var i = 0; i < 0; i++){document.write(i);}`
2. **While loop**: It's used to run a certaing code for an unkown amount of time depending on the state of the condition, the syntax should look like `while (var i < 10){_a certain code_ , _increament_;}, document.write(msg);`
3. **Do while loop**: It's used the same way while is used but it will still execute for one time even if the state of the condition is false.

## Comparison operators
When we want to use comparison operators we need to write first operand then the comparison operators then second operand
1. Is equall to `==`
2. Is not equall to `!=`
3. strict equal to `===`
4. strict not equal to `!==`
5. greater than `>`
6. less than `<`
7. greater than or equall `>=`
8. less than or equall `<=` 

## Logical operators
1. And `&&`
2. Or `||`
3. Not `!`

## Loops
loops always check a condition and if its correct the code inside it will execute until the condition be false .
types of loops
1. For loop
2. while loop
