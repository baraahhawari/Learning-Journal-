## Welcome to GitHub Pages
### Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

**Read**     [Mastering Markdown on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
**Watch**    [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
**Bookmark** [GitHub Markdown Syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/baraahhawari/Learning-Journal-/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [ jekyll-theme-midnight](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/baraahhawari/Learning-Journal-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
