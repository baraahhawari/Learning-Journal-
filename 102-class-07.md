## Javascript

JavaScript can be used to select any **element**, **attribute**, text from an HTML page. To **_add_ elements**, **attributes**, and **text** to the page, or **remove them**.


Also it could be used to **specify a set of steps for the browser to follow** *(like a recipe)*, which **allows it to access or change the content of a page**.

* Browser compatibility is very important for the code to work so make sure to use a modern browser like Chrome or FireFox

JavaScript is a programming langauge using **"Script"** as it's core principle, A script is a *series of instructions* that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. To **write** a script, you need to first **state** your **goal** and then **list** the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

Start with the **big picture** of what you want to achieve, and **break** that down into **smaller steps**. Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to be acheived. This can be **represented** using a **flowchart**, and translate these steps into code.

* Always think like you were the computer and it will be easier to find the right approch to write the code.

An expression **evaluates** into *(results in)* a single value, Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:

1. **EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE**
2. **EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE**


## Operators

Expressions rely on things called **operators**, they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values, there are many types of operators and each operator does a certain job, some of these operators are the following:

1. **ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS**: Assign a value to a variable `color = 'beige';`
2. **COMPARISON OPERATORS**: Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se `buy = 3 > 5;`
3. **ARITHMETIC OPERATORS**: Perform basic math `area = 3 * 2;`
4. **LOGICAL OPERATORS**: Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se `buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);`
5. **STRING OPERATORS**: Combine two strings `greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly';`


## Functions

* **Functions** let you **group** a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function *(rather than repeating the same set of statements)*.

* To **create** a function, give it a name and write the code needed to be executed inside the curly brackets, it should look like something like that `function sayHello(){document.write('Hello!')};`

* To execute *(call)* a function you write the function name followed by peranthasis, it should look like `sayHello();`

* Some functions need some information *(parameters)* to preform it's task, in such cases we put this information inside the **paranthesis**, and it should look like `function getArea(width, height){return width * height;}` were *(width and height)* are the parameters.

* To **call** a function that requires parameters, we replace the parameters with there **values** to be put in the function, it should look like `getArea(3,5)` where *(width= 3, and height= 5)*

* Some functions return an **output** when we call them, for example a **summation function** returns the result of adding naumbers.


#### how JS make web pages more interactive

You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML pag and moify content and do some magic with program rules and react to events 
  

## what is Expressions
there's two type of expressions:
1. assign a value to a variable like 
```javascript
 var variable = 'value' 
 ```
2. expressions that use two or more values to return a single value like
```javascript
    var variable = 5*2
```
variable now hold 10 (5 * 2 ) = 10

## what is functions

you write the function when you want someting to happend when the user do something like when user fill the profile info you want a function to fire when he finsh to save the input data

#### how to write a function

you need the keyword `function` after that the name of the function `myname` and code block within curly bracet `{return 'hello world}`

```javascript
    function myname(){
        return 'hello world'
    }
```

then you can fire the function by call it like this `myname()`

you can prepear the function to have some value to use it by tell him like so `function giveMeValue(iamValue)` and call it like so `giveMeValue('Hello there')`
